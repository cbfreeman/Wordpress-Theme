INSTALLATION & USAGE

The following steps will teach you how to achieve the structure of our theme demo sites. To learn the specifics of a specific theme, please read the 'readme' file for that theme.

Login to your WordPress admin panel and navigate to "Pages" -> "Add New". Fill in a page title - 'Home' for example (doesn't really matter) and then click the "Template" dropdown list. Select "Front Page" and then click the "Publish" button.

Go to "Settings" -> "Reading" and set the front page to display a static page -> from the "Front Page" dropdown list select the title of the page we created in the previous step. In my case that was "Home'.

Start adding posts to your site from "Posts" ->"Add New". Write title, text, images, video, etc. Choose category(- ies) and tags for the post. Then look at the bottom right panel and set a "Featured Image".

Menus. Navigate to "Appearance" -> "Menus" to set it up.

Featured Project. a special section to be used for the content of the featured content slider. Navigate to "Featured Project" -> "Add new Feature Project". All featured images added will be part of the front-page slider. After all is done, there is just one final step - specific for this themeâ€¦

Custom Header. To add the sitewide image that shows up at the top left of ALL pages. Navigate to "Appearance" -> "Header" -> upload your image.


Thats it - your done!
